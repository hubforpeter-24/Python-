    "### 1. Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are special tokens that represent computations like addition, multiplication and division. The values the operator works on are called operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two operands.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python \n",
    "    a = 5\n",
    "    b = 3 \n",
    "    # 5 & 3 values which are the operands\n",
    "    result = a + b  # result is 8\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    result = a - b  # result is 2\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two operands.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    result = a * b  # result is 15\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Division (`/`)**: Divides the numerator by the denominator, always returning a float.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Floor Division (`//`)**: Divides and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    result = a // b  # result is 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of the division.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
